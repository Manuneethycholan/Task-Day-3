1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2


HTTPS-1.1

Found in 1989 and released in 1997 by Tim Berners.

Uses -3 TCP connection and with a single stream of data flow.

Loads resources one after the other and can block the resources after the head of one resource if blocked.

Server pushes data only if the client asks for it.

Uses compression to pack data into smaller packs.

Less secure since transfer of data is in plain text format.




HTTPS-2

Developed by google in 2015.

Uses - 1 TCP connection but with multiple streams of data flow.( knows prioritisation of data streams.)

Loads resources even one resource is blocked since multiple streams of data are sent.

Server pushes data even before the client asks for it.(pushes js and css files without client request by pushing).

Uses compression Hpack mechanism to avoid redundant use of header packet.

More secure since data is transferred into binary format of packets.
